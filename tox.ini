    # Testing on Travis results in a bunch of warnings about `imp` being
    # deprecated due to setuptools importing it.  Changing jwodder-pyrepo's
    # install requirements to require setuptools>=41.6.0 (which, based on the
    # changelog, should not be importing `imp`) succeds in getting the latest
    # version of setuptools installed in the test environment, yet the warnings
    # keep occurring under Python 3.6 and 3.7 (Python 3.8 succeeds with the new
    # setuptools requirement but not under the previous commit).  This problem
    # only occurs on Travis, and I still can't figure out why.  Everything is
    # fine on my development machine and in a python:3.6 Docker container.
